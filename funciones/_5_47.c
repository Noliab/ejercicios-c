/*
    5.47
    (Craps Game Modification) Modify the craps program of Fig. 5.14 to allow wagering. Package as a 
    function the portion of the program that runs one game of craps. Initialize variable bankBalance 
    to 1000 dollars. Prompt the player to enter a wager. Use a while loop to check that wager
    is less than or equal to bankBalance, and if not, prompt the user to reenter wager until a valid wager
    is entered. After a correct wager is entered, run one game of craps. If the player wins, increase
    bankBalance by wager and print the new bankBalance. If the player loses, decrease bankBalance by
    wager, print the new bankBalance, check whether bankBalance has become zero, and if so print the
    message, "Sorry. You busted!" As the game progresses, print various messages to create some “chatter” 
    such as, "Oh, you're going for broke, huh?" or "Aw cmon, take a chance!" or "You're up big.
    Now's the time to cash in your chips!"
